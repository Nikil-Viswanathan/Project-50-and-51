                <p>Camel</p>

                <pre>
Camels are mammals with long legs, a big-lipped snout and a humped back.
There are two types of camels: dromedary camels, which have one hump,
and Bactrian camels, which have two humps.
Sand up the nose can be a problem, but not for camels.
They can shut their nostrils during sand storms.</pre>

                <p>Chameleon</p>

                <pre>
Chameleons are a very unique branch of the lizard group of reptiles.
Special color pigment cells under the skin called chromatophores allow
some chameleon species to change their skin color,
creating combined patterns of pink, blue, red, orange,
green, black, brown, yellow and purple.</pre>

                    <p>Pigeon</p>

                    <pre>
Pigeons are gentle, plump, small-billed birds with a skin saddle (cere) between the bill and forehead.
All pigeons strut about with a characteristic bobbing of the head.
Because of their long wings and powerful flight muscles, they are strong, swift fliers.

                    <p>Teddy Bear</p>

                    <pre>
A teddy bear is a stuffed toy in the form of a bear.
Since the creation of the first teddy bears which sought to imitate the form of real bear cubs,
"teddies" have greatly varied in form, style, color, and material.

                    <p>Panda</p>

                    <pre>
The giant panda, a black-and-white bear, has a body typical of bears.
It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, and shoulders.
The rest of the animal's coat is white.

                    <p>Flying Cicada</p>

                    <pre>
Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart, short antennae, and membranous front wings.
They have an exceptionally loud song,
produced in most species by the rapid buckling and unbuckling of drumlike tymbals.
